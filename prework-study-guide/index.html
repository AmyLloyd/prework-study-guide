          <li>This includes colours, aesthetics, visual layout and organisation.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is through an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>This is preferred as giving each section of code its own file is an example of the separation of concerns. This links to the concept that each section of code has its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>There are punctuation characters that have significant functions and meanings in CSS.</li>
